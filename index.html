    I am a Research Scientist and Invited Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://">ESRGv3</a>

    My research focus on virtualization for mixed-critical systems, with special attention on 
    minimizing interference for predictability and real-time guarantees. I also focus on 
    trusted execution environments for both high-end (mobile) and low-end (IoT) systems.
